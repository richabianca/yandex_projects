Another metric suggestion would be to cross-check data on how many credits the customer had simultaneously when they start to fail to pay their debit. Unfortunately with the data provided, such an analysis is not possible.\n",

Yet I know that Python does have specific methods to do this type of analysis. Also a ploting a graph would be usefull for this type of analysis.
