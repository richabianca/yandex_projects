Gaps for example can be filled with one median / mean or zero, but for educational purposes it would be better to handle more carefully. Moreover, there is nothing terrible there. Check negative values. Then you should pay attention to too large values (in a large number of rows) - when recalculated for years, they give 800-1100 years of experience (simply dividing by 365!), Which is unacceptable. Then maybe these are not days at all (not all rows, but only these \"giants\") ?! Perhaps it is enough to simply divide large values (by 24) and that's it, the data (available) will be ready (processed). And about filling in the gaps: ONLY now, when all the available values are correct, it will be possible to think about how to fill in the gaps ... here you can customize the filling of the gaps, for example, by the type of employment. \n","    \n","- gaps in income:  It would be better to fill in the gaps too. it would be acceptable to fill in one common average / median or zero if the data did not contain any other fields by which borrowers can be divided. Do employeses and student have equal average income? ;)\n","- gaps might be not only as Nan or Null. Look closely to 0-s at age...\n","- conclusion.

This means there is no special potential of default. However, I was not able to find a special correlation between having children, being married or special purposes to take out a loan. I assume that 8% of chances of having potential default clients as a very low percentage. It is not possible to affirm that a specific group is more or less suitable to pay their loans in time. In all comparisons, the maximum % of defaulting clients is 10%, number which I was not provided with specific criteria to confirm if it is a big or small number. In addition, the retrieved tables must be examined in details by a specialist in credit.
